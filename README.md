# Blockchain-Based Medicine Tracking System

Welcome to the **Blockchain-Based Medicine Tracking System** project! üöÄ This project aims to ensure the authenticity of internationally imported slimming pills and dietary supplements that are primarily sold online, not in pharmacies. By leveraging blockchain technology, we track these products through their barcodes, recording their locations and handlers. Users can verify the authenticity of these products using our web and mobile applications by scanning the QR codes.
